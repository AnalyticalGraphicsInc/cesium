 * @constructor
 *
 * @param {Cartesian3} center The center of the tile.  Vertex positions are specified relative to this center.
 * @param {Float32Array} vertices The vertex data, including positions, texture coordinates, and heights.
 *                       The vertex data is in the order [X, Y, Z, H, U, V], where X, Y, and Z represent
 *                       the Cartesian position of the vertex, H is the height above the ellipsoid, and
 *                       U and V are the texture coordinates.
 * @param {Uint8Array|Uint16Array|Uint32Array} indices The indices describing how the vertices are connected to form triangles.
 * @param {Number} indexCountWithoutSkirts The index count of the mesh not including skirts.
 * @param {Number} vertexCountWithoutSkirts The vertex count of the mesh not including skirts.
 * @param {Number} minimumHeight The lowest height in the tile, in meters above the ellipsoid.
 * @param {Number} maximumHeight The highest height in the tile, in meters above the ellipsoid.
 * @param {BoundingSphere} boundingSphere3D A bounding sphere that completely contains the tile.
 * @param {Cartesian3} occludeePointInScaledSpace The occludee point of the tile, represented in ellipsoid-
 *                     scaled space, and used for horizon culling.  If this point is below the horizon,
 *                     the tile is considered to be entirely below the horizon.
 * @param {Number} [vertexStride=6] The number of components in each vertex.
 * @param {OrientedBoundingBox} [orientedBoundingBox] A bounding box that completely contains the tile.
 * @param {TerrainEncoding} encoding Information used to decode the mesh.
 * @param {Number} exaggeration The amount that this mesh was exaggerated.
 * @param {Number[]} westIndicesSouthToNorth The indices of the vertices on the Western edge of the tile, ordered from South to North (clockwise).
 * @param {Number[]} southIndicesEastToWest The indices of the vertices on the Southern edge of the tile, ordered from East to West (clockwise).
 * @param {Number[]} eastIndicesNorthToSouth The indices of the vertices on the Eastern edge of the tile, ordered from North to South (clockwise).
 * @param {Number[]} northIndicesWestToEast The indices of the vertices on the Northern edge of the tile, ordered from West to East (clockwise).
