Thanks for contributing to Cesium!

If you have a question, do not submit an issue; instead, search the [Cesium forum](http://cesiumjs.org/forum.html).  The forum is very active and there are years of informative archives, often with answers from the core Cesium team.  If you do not find an answer to your question, start a new thread and you'll likely get a quick response.

If you think you've found a bug in Cesium, first search the [issues](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues).  If an issue already exists, please add a comment expressing your interest and any additional information.  This helps us prioritize issues.

If a related issue does not exist, submit a new one here.  Please be concise and include as much of the following information as is relevant:
* Minimum amount of sample code (and data) that can be copy and pasted into [Sandcastle](https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/index.html) to reproduce the issue.  For example, see [#2657](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2657).
* Screenshot or animated .gif if appropriate (try [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/)).  For example, see [#3153](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/3153).  Screenshots are particularly useful for exceptions and rendering artifacts.  If it is a rendering artifact, also include the output of [webglreport.com](http://webglreport.com/).
* Link to the thread if this was discussed on the Cesium forum or elsewhere.  For example, see [#3045](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/3045).
* Your operating system and version, browser and version, and video card.  Are they all up-to-date?  Is the issue specific to one of them?
* The version of Cesium.  Did this work in a previous version?
* Ideas for how to fix or workaround the issue.  Also mention if you are willing to help fix it.  If so, the Cesium team can often provide guidance and the issue may get fixed more quickly with your help.
